RPG Dice Roller
===============

This is fast becoming my traditional "learn a new language by coding this" script: a dice roller for tabletop RPGs.  This time, I'm learning wxPython!

Written in Python 2.5 and wxPython 2.8, though it might well support earlier versions.

Current systems supported: Old WoD (all editions), nWoD, Exalted, d20, 7th Sea, L5R and Shadowrun.  Feedback / suggestions of new systems to include are appreciated!

Use at your own risk, may make the world explode or various lesser symptoms (such as being eaten by a CR3 Dire Badger).

### New in version 0.3-20080522

Free Entry mode (under Miscellaneous) added.  Thanks to aefaradien for suggesting a better way to do this.  Input is sanitised, but there's still no real error handling so Free Entry probably falls over if you try anything too tricky.

### New in version 0.2-20080521

All seems up and running and bug-free.  GUI looks nicer.  Couple of things in the code could use tidying up, and there's no real error handling.

### New in version 0.1-20080520

Can't actually roll dice yet, but the data structures and whatnot are in there.  How enterprisey.  GUI works but is ugly.
